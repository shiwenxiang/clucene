TODO
----

* Some functions are missing... add these in
* finish other tests
* finish other extra query types/filters
* fix TODO items in code
* clean up help comments


FUTURE UPDATES
--------------

* More complete .NET managed version
* Java wrapper (JNI?)
* Python wrapper
* German analyzer
* porter stemmer

EFFICIENCY
----------
* Note that performance of debug applications can be slower by an order of ~5.
* Performance of analyzer seems to be quite bad. Should be able to be sped up alot.
* Memory Leaks - still quite a few!!!
* Join functions could be inlined?
* readString might be able to use non unique more often (reduce string copies)
* Function for getting documents starting from 100 - therefore first 100 docs would be worthlessly fetchhed.
