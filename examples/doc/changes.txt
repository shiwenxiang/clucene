CLucene license
===============
After much debate on the CLucene mailing-list it has been decided that CLucene will continue using the current LGPL license. We thank everyone for their input and agree with those that debate that LGPL is a license for the open source community. Therefore, in order to encourage other OS developers to improve CLucene and to provide a better tool back to the OS community, CLucene will continue to use LGPL as its standard license.

CLucene runs on Linux!
======================
Thanks to the efforts of Jimmy Pritts, CLucene now runs on Linux. See the 'INSTALL' file in the doc directory on how to use this tool. Please send feedback, bugs or problems relating to this.

No more binary distributions
============================
Sorry, but since CLucene runs on more than one platform, we won't be uploading binary distributions. Does anyone actually need them anyway? Alternatively, if anyone can help set up an automated build & distribute system on the compile farm it would then be possible to efficiently distribute binaries for different platforms.
