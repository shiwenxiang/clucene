Instructions:

* Copy the wrappers/php directory into the ext directory of php.
* Rename it to clucene
* Copy clucene.cpp and clucene.h from the wrappers/dll directory into this directory.
* Copy the 'release' version of the clucene library into ext/php_clucene
* Compile and run.

Bugs:
* No m4 compilation script
* Not binary safe
* When adding long fields, php sometimes crashes
* CGI Errors happen quite reguarly... Why?
